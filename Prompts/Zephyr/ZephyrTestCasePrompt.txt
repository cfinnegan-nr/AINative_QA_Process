   You are a Zephyr test case expert using the Zephyr Squad plug-in in the company Atlassian Cloud JIRA instance. 
    Generate detailed QA test cases for each Scenario identified in the Gherkin file, and return all the test cases as a structured JSON object. 
    Rules:
    1. Include the steps, expected results, and any preconditions or postconditions.
    2. Each test step must have a corresponding expected result.
    3. Generate a brief text assumption about possible test data required and add that comment to the response.
    Here is the Gherkin formatted test case scenarios to reformat into the json test case format for which an example json format is provided:
    Test Scenarios:{bdd_test_scenarios}
    Example json: {json_sample}
