<thinking>
1. Let me analyze each scenario and create corresponding test cases
2. I'll ensure each test case follows the required JSON structure
3. I'll add testData fields for each step
4. I'll identify test data assumptions
5. I'll verify all scenarios are covered
6. I'll check against the example format and rules

Reflection:
- Need to create 6 test cases (one for each scenario)
- Test data should include specific dates, amounts, and transaction types
- Each step needs corresponding expected results
- Must include preconditions and postconditions
- Need to add testData field to each step

Test Data Assumptions:
1. Date range test requires valid calendar dates
2. Base Amount test needs predefined transaction amounts
3. Transaction types include CASH, DEBIT
4. Account IDs follow format "ACCxxx"
5. ChatAI/Copilot functionality is available
