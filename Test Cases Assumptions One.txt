I'll help create detailed test cases based on the Gherkin scenarios provided. First, let me share an assumption about test data requirements:

Assumption for Test Data:
The test environment should contain:
- Multiple transactions with various Base Amounts
- Transactions with dates spanning at least 3 different dates
- Multiple CASH transactions
- Account ACC001 with multiple transactions
- Both Debit and Credit transactions
- Test data should include at least 3 transactions with the same Base Amount to test frequency filtering

Here's the JSON formatted test cases:
