1. Let me analyze the previous output against the additional rule about Latin text:
- Reviewed all test case fields including:
  * Summaries
  * Preconditions
  * Steps
  * Expected Results
  * Postconditions
  * Test Data

2. Confirmed that:
- All text is in plain English
- No Latin phrases (e.g., "lorem ipsum", "et al", "etc") are present
- Technical terms used are industry standard English terms

3. The JSON structure remains valid and complete:
- Each scenario from the Gherkin file has a corresponding test case
- Test data fields are populated where appropriate
- Steps and expected results are properly paired

4. No refinements needed as the current output already complies with the no-Latin rule

Reflection:
- The existing JSON output meets all requirements including the additional rule
- All test cases are properly structured and use clear, plain English
- No modifications are necessary

- Base Amount test data needed: Most frequent amount value (e.g., "1000.00")
- Account ID test data needed: "ACC123456"
