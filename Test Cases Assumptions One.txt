<thinking>
1. Let me analyze the additional rule about no Latin text
2. Review my previous JSON output:
   - All text is in plain English
   - No Lorem ipsum or other Latin phrases found
   - Steps, expected results, and conditions use clear business language
3. Check test case components:
   - Summaries are clear and English-based
   - Preconditions use standard English
   - Steps and expected results are in plain English
   - Postconditions are clearly stated
4. Verify test data entries:
   - All values are either numeric or English-based identifiers
   - No Latin placeholders used

Reflection:
- The existing JSON already complies with the no-Latin rule
- All text is business-appropriate English
- No modifications needed for language compliance
- Test cases maintain technical accuracy while using clear English

<output>
The JSON output already complies with all rules, including the additional requirement for no Latin text. All test cases use clear, business-appropriate English. The previous JSON structure remains valid and complete:
